Welcome to [TacticalGamer.com][tg]'s open-source mods repository.
See the [TGNS open-source mods repository][forum] forum thread for more info.
Mods in this repository are based on xToken's [DAK Admin Kit][dak].
There are a lot of customizations on [the server][tgns], but some of the highlights include:
  
__Captains__: Start a captains game, like a pickup game/gather/dodgeball

__WinOrLose__: The losing team can put down their weapons to force a must-end-the-game timer on the winning team

__TagLines__: Players can set text announcements when they join

__RookieThrottle__: Limit the number of rookies allowed to join when the server is close to full

There are also other gems here, like admin chat, spreading rookies on the randomall command for more even randoms, admin player mute notifications and more. TGNS welcomes open discussion about any of the plugins and their configuration on [the mod forum][forum].
